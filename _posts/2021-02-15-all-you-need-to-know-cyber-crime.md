### What is Cybercrime?
Cybercrime is known as computer crime. The use of computing machines as a weapon to do illegal activities, such as committing fraud, trafficking in child pornography intellectual property, stealing personal identities(credit card details, confidential data), or violating rules/policies.

### So, Where did it all start?
The first ransomware attack happened in 1989. The victim had to pay $189 in order to receive a repair tool. But as technology increases the level of crime also increases. In 2018 south Korean company ‘Nayana’ had to pay approximately $1 million in a ransomware attack.
20 years ago, malicious code, Trojans, and advanced worms were the most common cyber attacks. After ten years this has changed to spam sites, botnets, and DNS attacks. Today cybercrime includes ransomware, Pos attacks, online banking fraud, fake spam calls, banking malware, bitcoin wallet stealers. As Technology advances and hackers gain their knowledge , new types of threats create vulnerability that can lead to cyberattacks in various known or unknown ways.

### Types of Cybercrime:

#### Cyberterrorism:
A cyberterrorist is someone who launches computer-based attacks on computer-networks having confidential information stored on them. After gaining this information, cyberterrorist pressurize or scare the government or an organization for satisfying their demand.

#### Cyberextortion:
Hackers threaten with repeated denial of service or other attacks to computer systems, websites, e-mail servers. These hackers demand money in return to offer protection and for promising to stop the attacks.
An example of cyberextortion was the attack on sony pictures of 2014.(source : Wikipedia)
On November 24, 2014, a hacker group which identified itself by the name “Guardians of Peace” leaked a release of confidential data from the film studio Sony Pictures. The data included personal information about Sony Pictures employees and their families, e-mails between employees, information about executive salaries at the company, copies of then-unreleased Sony films, plans for future Sony films, scripts for certain films and other information. The perpetrators then employed a variant of the Shamoon wiper malware to erase Sony’s computer infrastructure.
During the hack, the group demanded that Sony withdraw its then-upcoming film The Interview, a comedy about a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, and threatened terrorist attacks at cinemas screening the film. After many major U.S. cinema chains opted not to screen The Interview in response to these threats, Sony elected to cancel the film’s formal premiere and mainstream release, opting to skip directly to a downloadable digital release followed by a limited theatrical release the next day.
United States intelligence officials, after evaluating the software, techniques, and network sources used in the hack, alleged that the attack was sponsored by the government of North Korea, who has since denied all responsibility.

#### Online Banking Scam:
Hackers send phishing mails to the victim or a specialized group of individuals of high importance and ask them to fill confidential banking information and sometimes ask them to pay for some products.

#### Vishing:
Nowadays, This the most common incident everywhere. The victim gets a call from attackers who acts likes he/she is from a trusted bank and asks the user to do some payment, ask them their banking credentials and OTP, etc.

#### Hacking android devices:
Many users download mod applications from 3rd party site or attacker sends any malicious file/application to the victim. This app/file contains a backdoor in it. This sends confidential data available in the device to the attacker over the network when a victim’s device is connected to the internet.
